# Numerical-Algorithms
Projects and their hands-on algorithms Aeronautical engineering's course : 

086172 - [Numerical Method in Aeronautical Engineering](https://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/Subjects.Heb/?Sub=86172).

**Syllabus** :
Development, analysis and implementation of finite difference numerical methods 
for solving classic type partial differential equations parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic.

**Final project - CFD** :
Fully developed flow entering narrow inlet, experiencing contraction at half size orifice, and finally exits developed at outlet.

**Cylindrical PDE project** :
Dynamic response of infinite cylinder that undergoes an harmonic oscillation in a direction
normal to its radial axis in an incompressible Newtonian fluid at rest.
